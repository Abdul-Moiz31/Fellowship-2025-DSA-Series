## ðŸ“– Understanding Fast and Slow Pointers

Fast and slow pointers are two references (or variables) that traverse a data structure at different speeds â€” typically used to:

- Detect cycles in linked lists or sequences
- Find the middle of a linked list
- Remove elements from the end with a gap
- Identify patterns where looping behavior exists

**How it works:**

- A **slow pointer** usually moves one step at a time.
- A **fast pointer** moves two steps at a time.
- If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer inside the loop.
- In non-cyclic scenarios, this technique helps locate midpoints, detect ends, or optimize traversal.

> This technique is especially useful in space-efficient solutions because it uses constant memory and doesn't require modifying the data.

## Suggestions

- Make short notes of the key approach after solving each problem.  
- Avoid spending more than 30â€“40 minutes on a single problem.  
- If stuck, look up the problem on YouTube using its number for guided explanations.  
- Practice tracing pointer movements with diagrams to strengthen your understanding.  
- Revisit problems after a few days to check retention and reinforce the pattern.

Stay consistent and try to recognize where the fast and slow pointer logic naturally fits in. With enough practice, this will become an intuitive part of your problem-solving toolkit.
