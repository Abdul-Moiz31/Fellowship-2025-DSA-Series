# Sliding Window Pattern

The **Sliding Window** technique is a method for handling problems that involve **contiguous subarrays or substrings** by maintaining a subset (window) of elements and moving it across the structure efficiently.

Instead of using **nested loops (O(n¬≤))**, sliding window allows you to process data in **linear time (O(n))**, reducing redundant calculations.

It applies mostly to problems involving:
- Arrays
- Lists
- Strings

### Real-Life Analogies:
- **Credit card spending tracker:** Keeping track of your spending in the past 30 days ‚Äì as new transactions come in, old ones are dropped.
- **Vehicle speed sensor:** Measures average speed in the last 5 seconds of driving.

## ‚ùì When to Use Sliding Window

Ask yourself these questions:

- Is the input an **array** or a **string**?
- Are you dealing with a **subarray** or **substring**?
- Are you trying to compute:
  - ‚úÖ Sum / Average
  - ‚úÖ Minimum / Maximum
  - ‚úÖ Length of longest or shortest window
  - ‚úÖ Character frequency or uniqueness
- Does the window **move left to right**?
- Are you looking to **optimize brute force O(n¬≤)**?

If yes, it‚Äôs probably a **Sliding Window** problem!

## ‚ùì Why It Works

- Reuses previously computed results to avoid redundant work
- Turns **O(n¬≤)** brute-force into **O(n)**
- Uses **two pointers** to represent the window
- Dynamically adjusts window size to meet problem constraints

## ‚ùì What are the Types of Sliding Windows

### 1. Fixed Size Window
- Use when **Window size is known** (typically `k`)
- Move one step at a time
- ‚úÖ Use case: max sum of subarray of size `k`

```cpp
int left = 0;
for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
    // Add right element to window

    if (right - left + 1 == k) {
        // Process the current window
        // Remove left element to slide
        left++;
    }
}
```

### 2. Variable Size Window
- Use when **Window size is not known** initially
- Dynamically expand/shrink based on condition
- ‚úÖ Use case: longest substring without repeating characters

```cpp
int left = 0;
for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
    // Expand window

    while (invalid_condition) {
        // Shrink window
        left++;
    }

    // Process the valid window
}
```

## ‚ùì How to Approach a Sliding Window Problem

‚úÖ Check if the problem involves **contiguous elements** (arrays, strings, etc.)

‚úÖ Decide the **window type**:
- **Fixed Size:** A constant `k` is given.
- **Variable Size:** Adjust the size dynamically based on a condition.

‚úÖ Use **two pointers:** `left` and `right` to manage the window boundaries.

‚úÖ Expand the window using `right++` to include more elements.

‚úÖ Shrink the window using `left++` when the condition is violated.

‚úÖ Process the window by tracking metrics like:
- min, max, average, count, etc.

‚úÖ Handle edge cases:
- Empty arrays
- `k > nums.size()`
- Negative numbers or potential overflows (use `long long` if needed)

## ‚ùï Common Patterns to Remember

‚úÖ **Expand Window**
```cpp
window += arr[right];
```
‚úÖ **Shrink Window**
```cpp
window -= arr[left];
left++;
```
‚úÖ **Calculate Window Size**
```cpp
int windowSize = right - left + 1;
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Forgetting to **shrink the window** when needed
- Incorrect **window size calculations**: `right - left + 1` vs `right - left`
- Mishandling **frequency maps** while shrinking
- **Off-by-one errors** in loops
- Using unnecessary **nested loops**
- Ignoring **edge cases** like string length < `k`

---

## ‚ùï Time & Space Complexity

### ‚è± Time Complexity
- **O(n)** ‚Äî Each element is added and removed from the window at most once.

### üß≥ Space Complexity
- **O(1)** ‚Äî When using basic counters or fixed operations.
- **O(k) or more** ‚Äî When using auxiliary data structures like:
  - `unordered_map` / `map` ‚Äî For frequency counting.
  - `set` ‚Äî For checking uniqueness or distinct values.
  - `deque` ‚Äî For tracking max/min in a window.

## üÜö Tip: Sliding Window vs Two Pointers

| Use Case | Go For             |
|----------|--------------------|
| Need to process contiguous subarrays/substrings?         | Sliding Window     |
| Working with sorted/unsorted arrays and need to move both ends independently (not necessarily contiguous)? | Two Pointers       |
| Need to expand and shrink based on a condition (like sum, distinct chars, etc.)? | Dynamic Sliding Window |

## üîÜ Final Thoughts

Sliding Window is one of the most **interview-worthy** patterns you must master. Practice recognizing its pattern, applying the right structure, and managing edge cases.

When you understand **why and when** to grow/shrink your window ‚Äî you'll turn brute force into beautiful linear-time solutions.
