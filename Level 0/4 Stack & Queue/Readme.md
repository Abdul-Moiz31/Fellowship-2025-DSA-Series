## ðŸ’¡ Suggestions

- Make sure to prepare your notes alongside solving each problem.  
- Don't spend more than 30â€“40 minutes on a single problem.  
- If you're stuck on a problem, search on YouTube using the problem number.  
- Try to solve a problem in multiple ways.  
- Practice visualizing the stack and queue operations (push, pop, enqueue, dequeue).  
- Understand LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle for stacks and FIFO (First In, First Out) for queues.  
- Master the basic operations before moving to complex problems involving stack/queue implementations.
