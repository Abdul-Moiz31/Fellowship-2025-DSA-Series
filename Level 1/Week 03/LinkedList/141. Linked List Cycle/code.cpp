/**
 * Approach:
 * We use Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm):
 * - Use two pointers: `slow` and `fast`.
 * - `slow` moves one step at a time, while `fast` moves two steps at a time.
 * - If there is no cycle, `fast` will eventually reach the end (NULL).
 * - If there is a cycle, `fast` and `slow` will eventually meet at some point within the cycle.
 * - We return true if they meet, otherwise false if the loop exits without meeting.
