using namespace std;

// ðŸ§  Approach:
// This problem simulates a queue of people buying tickets with time tracking.
// 1. Use a queue to store pairs of (position, remaining_tickets) for each person.
// 2. Track time as each person takes 1 second to buy a ticket.
// 3. When a person buys a ticket, decrement their remaining tickets.
// 4. If they still have tickets, they go to the back of the queue.
// 5. If they're done (0 tickets), they leave the queue.
// 6. Continue until the person at position k finishes buying all their tickets.
// 7. The key insight is to track the target person and count time for each ticket purchase.

// âœ… Time Complexity: O(tickets[k] * n), where n is the number of people
// âœ… Space Complexity: O(n), for the queue
