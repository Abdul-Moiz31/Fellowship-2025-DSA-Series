// ðŸ§  Approach:
// This problem simulates a queue of students trying to get sandwiches.
// 1. Use a queue to represent students and a stack (vector) for sandwiches.
// 2. At each step, check if the front student wants the top sandwich.
// 3. If yes, both student and sandwich are removed.
// 4. If no, student goes to the back of the queue.
// 5. Continue until no more students can get sandwiches (when we've gone through all students without any matches).
// 6. The key insight is to track when we've processed all students without any progress.

// âœ… Time Complexity: O(nÂ²), where n is the number of students
// âœ… Space Complexity: O(n), for the queue
