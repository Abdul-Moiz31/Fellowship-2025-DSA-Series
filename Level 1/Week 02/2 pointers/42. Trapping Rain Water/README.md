# 🧩 42. Trapping Rain Water

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Link:** [Leetcode - Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water)

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

---

## 📊 Examples

### Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

**Explanation:**  
In this case, 6 units of rain water are trapped between the elevations.

---

### Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

**Explanation:**  
Multiple dips in the terrain allow water to be trapped, resulting in 9 units in total.

---

## ✅ Constraints

- `1 <= height.length <= 2 * 10⁴`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10⁵`
