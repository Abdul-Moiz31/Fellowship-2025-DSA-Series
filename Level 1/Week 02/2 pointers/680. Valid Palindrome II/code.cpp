/*
âœ… Approach: Two Pointers with One Allowed Deletion

Problem:
You're given a string and allowed to **remove at most one character**.
Check if it's possible to make the string a **palindrome** after that.

ðŸ’¡ Idea:
Use the **Two Pointer** approach to compare characters from both ends.

Steps:
1. Start with two pointers: `l = 0` (left), `r = s.size() - 1` (right).
2. Move both inward as long as characters match: `s[l] == s[r]`
3. If a mismatch occurs:
   - You have **one chance** to skip either `s[l]` or `s[r]`
   - Check both possibilities:
     ðŸ”¹ Skip left â†’ Check if `s[l+1..r]` is a palindrome  
     ðŸ”¹ Skip right â†’ Check if `s[l..r-1]` is a palindrome
4. If either case is valid, return `true`
5. If no mismatches or a valid skip found â†’ the string is a palindrome with at most 1 deletion

âœ… Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
