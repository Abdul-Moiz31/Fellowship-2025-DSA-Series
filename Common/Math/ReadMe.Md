# 🧮 Basic Math in C++

Mathematics forms the backbone of logic and programming. Whether it's algorithms, game development, or data science—math is everywhere. Understanding the fundamentals of number theory, arithmetic, and mathematical logic is key to becoming a strong programmer.

This repository introduces **Basic Maths**, designed to strengthen your understanding of programming logic and foundational math concepts.

## 📘 What's Inside?

Each file in this collection solves a fundamental mathematical problem, commonly asked in coding interviews or helpful in building your algorithmic thinking. The implementations are simple, clean, and beginner-friendly.

We will cover problems like:
- Checking if a number is even or odd
- Finding digits in a number
- Checking for Armstrong or palindrome numbers
- Calculating GCD/HCF
- Reversing numbers
- And more...

## 📂 Problem Directories

Each problem will have its **own folder** with:
- Source code in C++
- Step-by-step explanation
